With epigenetic science, we can influence how genes express themselves by turning on the genes that signal cells to act healthy and turning off the genes that don't.</p><h2>Epigenetics In Action</h2><p>Our Chief Geneticist, Dr. Neal Kitchen, and his identical twin brother Dale have the same DNA but don't look the same. The reason? Epigenetics. Environmental factors starting in the womb signalled their genes to express themselves differently. You can spot the differences in their height and in the texture of their skin.</p><h2>Epigenetics & Your Skin</h2><p>Epigenetics applies to the genes that control your skin cells. HydroPeptide's team of geneticists formulate our products with powerful gene-signalling ingredients, like peptides, that tell your skin cells to act in a healthy, gorgeous way. </p><h2>We Have A Passion For Peptides</h2><p>As you can tell from our name, we use a lot of peptides in our products. We love peptides because they're one of the most effective epigenetic tools in skin care and we utilise them extensively in our transformative formulas. </p>",

No burning, no redness, no flaking.</li><li>3 FORMS OF RETINOIDS | A combination of 3 highly-intelligent retinoids (Retinol, Glyceryl Diretinoate & Retinyl Linoleate) are effectively released into their active form once they move through the layers of the skin. Each added at optimal levels for extended results.</li><li>SUPERIOR CONTROL-RELEASE SYSTEM | Extensive research was conducted to select retinoids that demonstrated synergetic  conversion rates. This allows for \"slow-release\" characteristics while maintaining optimal renewal activity without inflammation. Steady activity = maximum results without downtime. </li></ul>",
